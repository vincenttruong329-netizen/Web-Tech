Reflection:
1. What changed between your Stage 1 outline and your final HTML? Why did you change it?
- A lot had changed. Once I finished the stage 1 outline, I didn't like that everything was unformatted. 
To fix that, I had centered all the elements. I implemented a flexible layout in order to place my image next to the paragraph under "About Me."
- I had also chosen to not use ordered lists, because unordered lists just made more sense to use.
- I added more elements than what was asked of in order to achieve a presentable webpage.
- I had also used my hyperlink to plug in my social media instead of just linking it to my favorite website. 
I changed it, because I'm planning on building onto this webpage later on for a more professional usage.

2. What was the hardest part to implement correctly, and why?
- The hardest part to implement was putting the image and the textbox side by side along with keeping everything centered.
- I had only used flexbox once, so I had to tinker around with it a lot.

3. Describe one mistake you made and how you fixed it.
- One mistake was that once I had achieved the image and the textbox to be side by side, thne textbox was unformatted and ran off the screen.
To fix this, I had set a max width on for the paragraph, so that it would be forced to not run off.
