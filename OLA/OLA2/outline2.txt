Reflection:

-What changed and why?
    - Initially, I was just planning on keeping the OLA webpage the same and use the CSS file for the CV.html.
    I ended up deciding to remake the entire OLA 1 in order to allow it to use the CSS file, just to have more simple code
    and to be able to reuse code easier (for example, the double lines used for aesthetic purposes).
    - Doing this forced me to tweak with my code all over again to get it just right, in order for the photos to properly sit next
    to the textboxes.
-What was the hardest part and why?
    - The hardest part was figuring out why my code didn't work properly, even after the many different paths I've taken to achieve a
    certain 'look.' It was difficult with OLA1, and it was even more dificult and time consuming trying to replicate my old code but with CSS.
-One mistake and how it was fixed.
    - One mistake was from OLA1. My links that I had provided for the photos became invalid, or only worked sometimes. I decided to just add the
    photos locally and just relatively reference them.

- I apologize for the late submission, I had wanted to turn in my best work that I had found visually appealing.
And with that desire, I kept running into so many formatting errors, but I finally got it right!!
